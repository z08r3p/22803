SUBJECT OUTLINE 
22803 Quantitative Skills in Accounting and Finance 
Subject description 
This subject enables students to develop their ability to   collect, analyse   and   interpret   accounting   and   business   data   and to use the results of the analysis for decision   making.   The   subject   emphasises   the   development   of a   practical understanding of various analytical techniques. Students learn how   to   apply   these   techniques   using   statistical   tools   and to   implement the results of their analysis in   practical   business decisions.   These   skills   and   competencies   are essential for a future career in accounting and finance   in   either   industry   and   practice.
Subject learning objectives (SLOs) 
Upon successful completion of this subject students should   be able to:
1. explain the role of statistical analysis for decision   making   in   accounting   and   business
2. identify the sources of accounting and business   data   and   collect   data from   these   sources   for   analysis
3. identify and effectively apply commonly   used statistical   methods   and techniques   to   financial   and   non-financial   data
4. generate, analyse, and review statistical   data   including   hypothesis testing
5. effectively   interpret, communicate and present the results   of quantitative   analyses   and   make   relevant   predictions   to facilitate decision making including the   use   of charts   and tables
Contribution to the development of graduate attributes 
The subject provides students with essential knowledge   and   skills   required   in   the   career   of a   professional   accountant.   The subject introduces students to quantitative methods   and   statistical   analysis who   have   not   had   any   academic research   background.   It enables students to understand the role   that   quantitative   methods,   data   collection   and analysis could   play   in   business decision   making and the   importance of ethics and   professional   integrity   in the   practice   of professional accountants.
The subject contributes to the development of the following   Program   Learning Objective:
.   Apply ethical   principles and   professional   integrity   in the context of professional accounting   practice   (4.2)
Teaching and learning strategies 
This subject is taught using a   mix of face-to-face teaching,   online   resources   and   self-directed   study.
Tutorials:   In the first   part of the class, students are expected to work   in   groups to   solve   in-class   exercises.   Tutorials provide students with the opportunity to review and discuss   concepts   and   receive   feedback.   Students   are   expected   to contribute and to   participate   in group discussions and to ask   questions.   Pre-class   preparation   is   required to   solve   the   in-class   problems.
Lectures: The second   part of class   is dedicated to a lecture.   Lectures   are   designed   to   introduce   the   analytical   tools      which are the focus of the subject and to demonstrate   practical examples.   Lectures   do   not   cover the   course   content      in-depth but provide an overview of each   topic   and   explain   the   more   difficult   concepts   using   practical   examples   and         demonstration questions.   Lecture slides are available   prior to class   on   the   course   site.   Students   are   expected   to   add   their own additional   notes and explanations.   It is   recommended that students   read   the   relevant   textbook   chapter/s prior to attending the scheduled lecture on that topic.   This   background   reading   is   essential to   setting   the   scene   for   the   lecture. This activity will be completed in   collaboration with   other students   and   provides   students with   the   opportunity to obtain in-class peer feedback   on   their   learning. 
Pre-class preparation: Students are expected to review   prior week’s   lectures   notes,   undertake the   relevant   readings,   watch videos and complete the self-study exercises before   attending   class   in   order to   successfully   engage   in   in-class      exercises. The assigned weekly self-study questions and solutions are   made   available   on the   learning   management   system.
Discussion board: Student learning in this   subject   is   also facilitated   through   online   discussion forums which   are available throughout session to all students on the learning   management   system.   These   discussion   forums   can   be   used to ask questions relating to subject content   and   subject   administration.   The   forums   therefore   provide   an alternative method of obtaining feedback on your learning from subject   staff or   other   students.

regular basis   prior to or during a synchronous class   such   as weekly   homework   preparation,   pre-class   or   in-class
quizzes or single assessments that are performed and   assessed   during   class   time   such   as   presentations)   submitted   after the due date and time,   will   be   either:
.   penalised   by   way   of   loss   of   marks   where   10 per   cent   (10%)   of   the   marks   for   the   assessment   task   will   be   deducted per day for assessment tasks submitted after the due date. A   day   is   defined   as   a   24-hour   period   or   part thereof
following the published due date and time   of the   assignment,   and
